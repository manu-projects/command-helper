# The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.
# Like the rest of the GNU system, these programs mostly conform to POSIX, with BSD and other extensions
#
# New features need to
# - follow POSIX rules
# - be portable/should not break portability
#
# GNU Coreutils Project started in by merging of Fileutils, Shellutils and Textutils projects
# These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.
# - fileutils (cp, mv, ls, rm, du, dd df, mkdir, shred)
# - shellutils (date, echo, pwd, sleep, id, printf, tee, whoami)
# - texutils (cat, tr, sort, wc, md5sum, head, uniq)
